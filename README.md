# CIA-Factbook
 
In this project, we use SQL to analyze some data from the CIA Factbook. The CIA Factbook is a compendium of countries and some of their attributes, for example: population, land area, birth rate, death rate, migration rate, etc. We use this dataset to answer a couple of questions, including the following:
- What is the minimum and maximum population and population growth?
- What countries are most densely populated?
- Which countries have the highest ratio of water to land?
- What countries are at risk of overpopulation? What about underpopulation?
